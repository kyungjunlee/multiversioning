Warning: This is still a work in progress.

Library dependencies:

The project links with the cityhash and libnuma libraries.
For tcmalloc, please look at the gperftools library.
The source for each dependency can be respectively found at:

https://github.com/google/cityhash.git
https://github.com/numactl/numactl.git
https://github.com/google/googletest
https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools

The resulting libraries and header files must be installed in the
libs/ directory. Pass --prefix=$(MV_DIR)/libs/ while configuring the
libraries so that they're installed in the right location.
